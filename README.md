# Simon_Game

This is a simple application built for practicing JS. The user presses any key to begin the game and a square is randomly chosen to start the sequence. The user then clicks the same square as was chosen then and another square is randomly added to the sequence, with this repeating as long as the user is able to correctly repeat the entire pattern each turn.
