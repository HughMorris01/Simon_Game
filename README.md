# Simon_Game

This game was made along with instruction from Udemy's 2023 Web Developer Bootcamp. The user presses a key to begin the game and a square is randomly chosen to start the sequence. The user then clicks the same square and another square is randomly added to the sequence, with this repeating as long as the user is able to correctly repeat the entire pattern each turn.
